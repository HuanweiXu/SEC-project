                        --------------------------------      4.01 Agreement Not to Compete, Not to Solicit and to Maintain

Agreement and ending three (3) years from the Closing Date (the "Non-Compete
Term"), Seller shall not, and shall use its best efforts to ensure that any
agents, representatives and any other Persons acting on its behalf (Seller and
such agents, representatives, and other Persons being collectively referred to
as the "Restricted Persons") do not, directly or indirectly, for the benefit of
any Restricted Person or any of their respective Affiliates:                  (i) induce, persuade, or attempt to induce or persuade any
            customer of the Business to divert any of its business away from the

confidentiality as Seller afforded such Confidential Information prior to the
date hereof, in the ordinary course of business (i.e., if any of the
Confidential Information was disclosed to, or used or exploited on behalf of,
any Person other than Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates). Accordingly, Seller covenants and agrees that Seller shall not, and
shall use its best efforts to ensure that each other Restricted Person does not,
without the prior written consent of Purchaser, disclose, use or exploit any
such Confidential Information, for the benefit of any of such Restricted Persons
or of any third party, except that Seller may disclose, use or exploit a
particular item of Confidential Information if and to the extent (but only if
and to the extent) that such item:            (i) is or becomes publicly known or generally known in the industry
      through no act of any Restricted Person or otherwise in violation of this
      Section 4.01;

<PAGE>            (ii) is required to be disclosed to or by order of a Governmental
      Authority or a court of law or otherwise as required by applicable law;
      provided, that prior to any such disclosure, notice of such requirement of
      disclosure is provided to Purchaser and Purchaser is afforded the
      reasonable opportunity to object to such disclosure;            (iii) is disclosed to Seller by a third party, provided that such
      disclosure is not prohibited by any legal, contractual, fiduciary or other
      confidentiality obligation owed to Purchaser; or            (iv) is required to be disclosed to the parties' attorneys,
      accountants or other agents or employees in connection with the
      transactions contemplated by this Agreement.      4.02 Tax Matters.
           -----------            (a) Tax Returns. Seller shall duly prepare, or cause to be prepared,
and file, or cause to be filed at its own expense, on a timely basis all Tax
Returns with respect to the Company, to the extent relating to income taxes, for
any taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date, as set forth on
Schedule 4.02(a). Such Tax Returns shall be filed on a basis consistent with the
past practice of the Company. Purchaser shall duly prepare, or cause to be
prepared, and file at its own expense, or cause to be filed, all Tax Returns
with respect to the Company for any taxable periods ending after the Closing
Date. Unless Seller's written consent is first obtained or unless required by
applicable law, Purchaser shall not take any action which would in any way alter
the balance of Taxes owing or Tax refunds or credits obtainable with respect to
any period ending on or before the Closing Date.            (b) Cooperation on Tax Matters. Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 4.02
(including amended Tax Returns for any tax period prior to the Closing Date (or
portions thereof) that Seller may reasonably request Purchaser to file) and any
Audit. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other party's
request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant
to such Audit. Neither Purchaser nor Seller shall dispose of any records
relating to Taxes paid or payable by the Company and which are attributable to
Pre-Closing Tax Periods prior to the later of the expiration of the applicable
limitations period on assessment with respect to any such Taxes, the sixth
anniversary of the Closing Date or the final resolution of all litigation
initiated prior to the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date relating to any
such Taxes.            (c) Seller shall be responsible for all income taxes of the Company
for all taxable periods or portions thereof ending on or before the Closing
Date. In the case of any taxable period that includes but does not end on the
Closing Date, the amount of any such Taxes based on or measured by income or
receipts shall be allocated between the portions of such taxable period before
and after the Closing Date based on an interim closing of the books method, and
the amount of any other such Taxes shall be allocated between the portions of
such taxable period that are before and after the Closing Date proportionately
based on the number of days in each such portion.

<PAGE>      4.03 Referral of Business. Purchaser agrees that if it is solicited by its
customers or by a potential customer for Voice over Internet Protocol services,
and Purchaser is not providing such services at the time of such solicitation,
then Purchaser will refer such customer to Seller. If Seller receives an inquiry
from a potential customer who is seeking traditional wireline telephony services
in any jurisdiction in which Purchaser is then operating, and Seller is not
currently selling wireline services in such jurisdiction, Seller agrees that the
potential customer will be instructed to contact Cyber Digital for such
services. In either case, the party that makes such customer referral will be
paid a referral fee of $50 per line by the other party for any customer line
that is actually and successfully provisioned and billed by such other party.      4.04 Customer Service Sharing. Purchaser acknowledges that customer
service employees of the Company are trained to provide customer service support
services to customers of an Affiliate of Seller, VoX Communications Corp.
("VoX"). Purchaser agrees to allow such customer service to VoX to continue for
a minimum period of six months after the Closing Date on a basis consistent with
past practice. On a monthly basis, Seller will reimburse Purchaser at a rate of
thirty-five cents a minute for customer service provided to Seller, based on the
number of inbound minutes on the VoX toll free number that rings in the customer
service center of the Company.      4.05 Employee Leasing Agreement. At or prior to the Closing, Cyber
Digital, Acquisition Sub and Seller shall enter into an employee leasing
agreement, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Employee
Leasing Agreement"), which shall provide, among other things, that during the
twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, each of (i) Paul H. Riss, the
current Chief Executive Officer of Seller, (ii) Frank Tosi, the current
Controller of Seller, and (iii) Lauri Vertrees, the current Operations Manager

specified therein.      4.06 Conduct of the Business Pending Closing. From and after the date

contemplated hereby without obtaining the prior
                                       13
<PAGE>written approval of each of the other parties hereto, unless, in the reasonable
and good faith judgment of Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, upon the
advice of counsel, disclosure is otherwise required by applicable law or by the

lists securities; provided, that, to the extent required by applicable law, the
party intending to make such release shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts consistent with applicable law to consult with the other party with

from the date hereof to the Closing; provided, however, that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 4.09 shall not limit or otherwise affect the

                                       14
<PAGE>Seller so requests, Purchaser or its Representatives shall be accompanied by a

upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, with the chief
financial officer and other officers of the Company responsible for the
Company's financial statements and internal controls to discuss such matters as
Purchaser may deem necessary or appropriate, among other things, in order to
enable Purchaser, following the Closing, to satisfy its obligations under
applicable law. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) no
investigation or receipt of information pursuant to this Section 4.10(a) shall
qualify any representation or warranty of Seller or the conditions to the
obligations of Purchaser, (ii) no such investigation or examination pursuant to
this Section 4.10(a) shall be permitted to the extent that it would require
Seller or the Company or any of their Subsidiaries to provide any information or
access that Seller or the Company reasonably believes could violate any
applicable law, or conflict with any confidentiality obligations to which
Seller, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries is bound or cause the
forfeiture of any attorney-client privilege and (iii) prior to the Closing,
without the prior written consent of a Representative of Seller or the Company
(who shall be identified in writing to Purchaser as the Representative
contemplated by this provision), (x) Purchaser shall not contact any suppliers
to, or customers of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of this

Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Purchaser
and to provide such assistance as Purchaser may reasonably request to enable
Purchaser, from and after the Closing, to prepare such financial statements for
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries (including the Company, following the Closing) as
may be required by applicable law or by the applicable rules of any stock
exchange on which Cyber Digital lists securities.      4.11 Use of Certain Assets. From and after the Closing, (a) Purchaser

and/or filing, including by furnishing to Purchaser any information in the
possession of Seller or the Company, as the case may be, required for any such
application and/or filing.
                                       15
<PAGE>            (b) Each of Purchaser and Seller, as the case may be, shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be
asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in connection with the Regulatory Approvals. In
connection therewith, if any Legal Proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement in
connection with the Regulatory Approvals, each of Purchaser and Seller shall
cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any such
Legal Proceeding, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any
order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents, or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. In connection with the foregoing, each of Purchaser and
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take promptly any and all
steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment arising in
connection with the Regulatory Approvals that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority, so as to enable the parties to close the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as expeditiously as possible.                                    ARTICLE V                    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

Except as otherwise set forth in the Schedules, Seller represents and warrants
to Purchaser as follows:            5.01 Organization. The Company is duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the State of New York. The Company has no
Subsidiaries. The Company has all requisite power and authority to enable it to
own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as presently conducted. The Company is duly qualified and in good
standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business
or the ownership, leasing or holding of its properties makes such qualification
necessary, except where the absence of such qualifications, individually or in
the aggregate, would not have, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a
Material Adverse Effect. The Company maintains a company minute book (and other
similar records of organizational or management proceedings), copies of each of
which have previously been provided to Purchaser.            5.02 Shares and Related Matters; No Investments.
                 ------------------------------------------            (a) Seller owns in the aggregate 100% of the issued and outstanding
shares of the Common Stock, which constitute 100% of the issued and outstanding
shares of the capital stock of the Company. As of the Closing (but immediately
prior to the execution of the New Note Documents), the Shares will be validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable, will be free and clear of all
Encumbrances (other than any Encumbrances created by the Existing Note
Documents), and will not be subject to any pre-emptive rights or other similar
rights of shareholders of the Company. There are no shares of preferred stock of
the Company outstanding.
                                       16
<PAGE>            (b) The Company has no outstanding instruments convertible into or
exchangeable for any capital stock in the Company or containing any profit
participation features, nor does it have outstanding any rights or options to
subscribe for or purchase any instruments convertible into or exchangeable for
any capital stock in the Company. The Company is not subject to any obligation
(contingent or otherwise) to repurchase or otherwise acquire or retire any
capital stock or any warrants, options or other rights to acquire any capital
stock in the Company.            (c) There are no preemptive rights or rights of refusal with respect
to the sale of the Shares hereunder. Assuming the truth and accuracy of the
representations and warranties contained in Section 6.08, the offer, sale and
issuance of the Shares as contemplated by this Agreement are exempt from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act and any applicable U.S. state
securities laws, and neither Seller nor any authorized agent acting on its
behalf has taken or will take any action hereafter that would cause the loss of
such exemptions.            (d) The Company does not own or hold any Investment in any Person.      5.03 Authorization. Seller has all requisite power and authority to enter
into this Agreement and the other agreements, instruments, documents and
certificates (collectively, the "Related Documents") to be executed and
delivered by Seller in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. All
corporate acts and other proceedings required to be taken by Seller or the
Company to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
and the Related Documents to which it is a party, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, have been duly and properly taken.      5.04 Valid and Binding. This Agreement constitutes (and, when executed and
delivered at Closing, each Related Document will constitute) a valid and binding
obligation of Seller, enforceable against Seller in accordance with its terms,
except that (a) such enforcement may be limited by or subject to any bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws now or hereafter in
effect relating to or limiting creditors' rights generally and (b) the remedy of
specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief are
subject to certain equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before
which any proceeding therefor may be brought.      5.05 Consents and Approvals of Governmental Authorities. No consent,
approval or authorization of, or declaration, filing or registration with, any

the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, except for (a) informational filings with
the SEC and as may be required under state securities or "blue sky" laws and (b)

delivery and performance of this Agreement and each Related Document by Seller,
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and
the compliance by Seller with the terms hereof and thereof, does not and will
not contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation of or default under
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both), or give rise to a right of
                                       17
<PAGE>termination, cancellation, modification or acceleration of any obligation or
loss of any benefit under, result in the creation or imposition of any

notices, consents, waivers and approvals of parties or third-party beneficiaries
to any Subsisting Contracts as are required thereunder in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance by Seller of this Agreement and the Related
Document and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, or for any such Subsisting Contract to remain in full force and effect
without limitation, modification or alteration after the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the Related Document and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, so as to preserve all rights
of, and benefits to, the Company under such Subsisting Contracts. Following the
Closing Date, the Company will be permitted to exercise all of its rights under
the Subsisting Contracts without the payment of any additional amounts or
consideration other than any ongoing obligations, fees, royalties or payments
which the Company would otherwise be required to satisfy, perform or pay
pursuant to the terms of such Subsisting Contracts had the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement not occurred.      5.07 Financial Statements.

Seller (the "Audited Financial Statements" and, together with the Unaudited
Financial Statements, the "Financial Statements") for the fiscal years ended

prepared by the Company or Seller on the basis of the books and records
maintained in the ordinary course of business in a manner consistently used and
applied throughout the periods involved. The Financial Statements fairly present
the financial condition and operating results of the Company as of the dates,
and for the periods, indicated therein, subject in the case of the Unaudited
Financial Statements to normal year-end audit adjustments. Except as disclosed
in the Financial Statements, the Company is not a guarantor or indemnitor of any

and against such risks and losses, as are customary for companies engaged in
businesses similar to the Business to protect the Business, the Assets, and the
employees, properties and operations of the Company and will continue such
insurance in effect through the Closing. These policies are provided through
coverage secured by Seller for assets owned by Seller, and will not be available
to the Company
                                       23

connection with any other event, will (x) result in any payment (including any
severance, unemployment compensation or golden parachute payment) becoming due
to any employee, former employee, consultant or former consultant, (ii) increase
any benefits otherwise payable to any such persons, or (iii) result in the
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits to any

currently employed by the Company in the Business (the "Employees") and accurate

Pennsylvania. The Company has complied in all material respects with all
requirements in connection therewith, and the Company is not in default in any
material respect under any of such licenses, franchises, permits or other
similar authorizations. Seller has no reason to believe that all franchises,
permits, licenses, and any similar authorizations necessary for the conduct of
the Business by the Company in the States of New York, New Jersey and
Pennsylvania will not be granted in the ordinary course within a reasonable
period of time after application therefor, and prior to the time the same is

            presently conducted;            (b) Seller knows of no facts that could reasonably be expected to

respective present or former directors, officers, or employees, affecting,
involving or relating to the Business or the Assets.            (c) No Governmental Authority has challenged or questioned the legal

forms of equitable relief are subject to certain equitable defenses and to the
discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.      6.04 Consents and Approvals of Governmental Authorities. No consent,

any certificate or other Related Document furnished by Purchaser to Seller in
connection with this Agreement contains or will contain any untrue statement of
material fact or omits or will omit to state a material fact necessary to make

warrants to Seller as follows:            (a) Purchaser is familiar with the Business and the Company.            (b) Purchaser has been advised that the Shares may not be sold,
transferred, or otherwise disposed of except as provided herein, and understands
that the Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act, or any state
securities laws, in reliance on an exemption for private offerings or the fact
that the Shares are not securities and, if the Shares are securities,
                                       29
<PAGE>Purchaser may not be able to resell such Shares unless registered under the
Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws or unless an exemption
from such registration is available.            (c) Purchaser is a "sophisticated investor" with substantial prior
experience in business investments of the type described in this Agreement, and
is aware of and familiar with the risks associated with the Business and the
Company, and would qualify as an "accredited investor" as such is defined in
Rule 501 of Regulation D, as enacted pursuant to Sections 3(b) and 4(2) of the
Securities Act.            (d) Purchaser is acquiring the Shares for its own account, for
investment only and with no present intention of distributing, reselling,
pledging, or otherwise disposing of such Shares, or any portion thereof.            (e) Purchaser is familiar with the type of investment which the
Shares constitute and has reviewed the acquisition of such Shares with its legal
counsel and other advisors to the extent it deems necessary.            (f) Purchaser acknowledges that the Shares may have to be held
indefinitely and that Purchaser can afford to do so, and to lose its entire
investment in the Shares.            (g) Purchaser recognizes that there has been no public market for
the Shares and that after its acquisition of the Shares, there will be no such
market, and Purchaser understands that it cannot expect to be able to freely
liquidate the Shares in case of emergency.            (h) Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, no
representations or warranties have been made to Purchaser by Seller or by any
agent, employee, director or affiliate thereof and, in entering into the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Purchaser is not relying upon any
information other than the results of its own independent investigation.                                   ARTICLE VII                              CONDITIONS TO CLOSING      7.01 Conditions Precedent to the Obligations of Purchaser Hereunder. All

from Seller; and            (e) Purchaser shall have delivered to Seller, or shall have caused

           -----------------------------------------------------------      8.01 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations and
warranties made by each party hereto in this Agreement or in the attached
Schedules or in any exhibit or certificate delivered pursuant hereto shall
survive the Closing hereunder and any investigation at any time made by or on
behalf of any other party through the first anniversary of the Closing Date;
provided, however, that the representations and warranties of Seller set forth
in Sections 5.01, 5.02, 5.03, 5.04, 5.09 and 5.21, and the representations and
warranties of Purchaser set forth in Sections 6.01, 6.02, 6.03 and 6.04, shall
survive until the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitations
(including all periods of extension, whether automatic or permissive).      8.02 Notice of Damages. If either party seeks indemnity hereunder (the
"Indemnified Party"), the Indemnified Party shall give the other party from whom
indemnity is sought hereunder (the "Indemnitor") prompt notice (hereinafter, the
"Indemnification Notice") of any demands, claims, actions or causes of action
(collectively, "Claims") asserted against the Indemnified Party. Failure to give
such notice shall not relieve the Indemnitor of any obligations which the
Indemnitor may have to the Indemnified Party under this Article VIII, except to
the extent that such failure has materially adversely prejudiced the Indemnitor
under the provisions for indemnification contained in this Agreement. For
purposes of this Article VIII, Acquisition Sub or Cyber Digital, on the one
hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall be deemed to be the "Indemnified
Party" or the "Indemnitor", as the case may be.      8.03 Agreements to Indemnify.
           -----------------------            (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Article VIII, Seller
covenants and agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Acquisition Sub,
Cyber Digital and their Affiliates (including any officer, director,
stockholder, partner, member, employee, agent or representative of any thereof)
(a "Purchaser Affiliate") from and against all assessments, losses,
                                       32
<PAGE>damages, liabilities, costs and expenses, including without limitation interest,
penalties and reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel chosen by
Acquisition Sub, Cyber Digital or a Purchaser Affiliate (collectively,
"Damages"), imposed upon or incurred by Acquisition Sub, Cyber Digital or any
Purchaser Affiliate arising out of or in connection with or resulting from (i)
any breach of any representation or warranty of, or non-fulfillment of any
covenant or agreement of, Seller contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement
or any Schedule hereto, or any certificate furnished or to be furnished to
Purchaser hereunder or thereunder, or (ii) any of the matters described on
Schedule 8.03(a) hereto; provided, that with respect to each such matter set
forth on Schedule 8.03(a), Seller's indemnification obligations hereunder with
respect thereto shall not exceed the amount set forth opposite such matter on
such Schedule 8.03(a). Seller further covenants and agrees to indemnify, defend
and hold harmless any Purchaser Affiliate and the Company from and against all
Taxes for which Seller is responsible under Section 4.02(c) hereof to the extent
that such Taxes exceed the reserve established therefor.            (b) Each of Acquisition Sub, Cyber Digital and, from and after the
Closing, the Company, covenants and agrees to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Seller and its Affiliates (including any successor or assign, officer,
director, stockholder, partner, member, employee, agent or representative
thereof) ("Seller Affiliates") from and against all Damages imposed upon or
incurred by such Indemnified Party arising out of or in connection with or
resulting from any breach of any representation or warranty of, or
non-fulfillment of any covenant or agreement of, Acquisition Sub or Cyber
Digital contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement or any certificate or
other instrument furnished or to be furnished to Seller hereunder or thereunder.            (c) The Indemnitor shall reimburse the Indemnified Party promptly
after delivery of an Indemnification Notice certifying that the Indemnified
Party has incurred Damages after compliance with the terms of this Article VIII,
provided, however, that the Indemnitor shall have the right to contest any such
Damages in good faith.      8.04 Conditions of Indemnification of Third Party Claims. The obligations
and liabilities of an Indemnitor under Section 8.03 hereof with respect to
Damages resulting from Claims by Persons not party to this Agreement shall be
subject to the following terms and conditions:            (a) Promptly after delivery of an Indemnification Notice in respect
of a Claim, and subject to paragraph (c) of this Section 8.04, the Indemnitor
may elect, by written notice to the Indemnified Party, to undertake the defense
thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, at the
sole cost and expense of Indemnitor. If the Indemnitor chooses to defend any
claim, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with all reasonable requests of the
Indemnitor and shall make available to the Indemnitor any books, records or
other documents within its control that are necessary or appropriate for such
defense.            (b) In the event that the Indemnitor, within a reasonable time after
receipt of an Indemnification Notice, does not so elect to defend such Claim,
the Indemnified Party will have the right (upon further notice to the
Indemnitor) to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such Claim for
the account of the Indemnitor, subject to the right of the Indemnitor
                                       33
<PAGE>to assume the defense of such Claim pursuant to the terms of paragraph (a) of
this Section 8.04 at any time prior to settlement, compromise or final
determination thereof, provided, that the Indemnitor reimburses in full all
costs of the Indemnified Party (including reasonable attorney's fees and
expenses) incurred by it in connection with such defense prior to such
assumption.            (c) Anything in this Section 8.04 to the contrary notwithstanding,
(i) if the Indemnified Party believes there is a reasonable probability that a
Claim may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to participate in the defense, compromise or
settlement of such Claim, provided that the Indemnitor shall not be liable for
expenses of separate counsel of the Indemnified Party engaged for such purpose,
and (ii) no Person who has undertaken to defend a Claim under Section 8.04(a)
hereof shall, without the written consent of all Indemnified Parties, settle or
compromise any Claim or consent to entry of any judgment which does not include
as an unconditional term thereof the release by the claimant or the plaintiff of
all Indemnified Parties from all liability arising from events which allegedly
give rise to such Claim.      8.05 Pursuit of Claims; Limitation on Indemnification. Any breach of any
representation or warranty as to which a bona fide claim for indemnification has
not been asserted in accordance with Section 8.03 hereof prior to 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on the date of the expiration of the applicable survival period
set forth in Section 8.01 hereof may not be pursued, and hereby is irrevocably
waived. If a claim for indemnification is made in accordance with Section 8.03
prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date of the expiration of the
applicable survival period set forth in Section 8.01, then, notwithstanding such
survival period, the representation or warranty applicable to such claim will
survive until, but only with respect to any such claim that was timely made and
only for the purpose of, the resolution of such claim by final, nonappealable
judgment or settlement. In any event, the parties shall fully cooperate with
each other and their respective counsel in accordance with Section 8.04 in
connection with any such litigation, defense, settlement or other attempted
resolution.      8.06 Limitation upon De Minimis Indemnification Obligations. Except for
Claims for the indemnification of any Tax or any breach of Section 5.09 hereof,
no party hereunder shall be required to indemnify the other party hereunder
until such time as the Indemnified Party's actual Damages in the aggregate equal
or exceed $50,000, at which time the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for
the entire amount of Damages incurred.                                   ARTICLE IX                                    RESERVED

hereto will pay its own expenses incurred by or on its behalf in connection with
this Agreement or any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, whether or not
such transaction shall be

hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and
their respective successors and
                                       35
<PAGE>permitted assigns. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto without the
prior written consent of the other party, except by operation of law; provided,
however, that (i) Acquisition Sub or Cyber Digital may assign all or part of
this Agreement or its rights hereunder (a) to a Purchaser Affiliate, (b) to

and after the Closing, to a Person not a party to this Agreement which acquires
all or substantially all of the assets of Acquisition Sub or Cyber Digital and
who assumes all of the obligations of Acquisition Sub or Cyber Digital
hereunder, as the case may be, provided in each such case that no such
assignment shall release Acquisition Sub or Cyber Digital, as the case may be,
from its duties and obligations hereunder, and (ii) Seller may assign all or
part of this Agreement or its rights hereunder to an Affiliate of Seller who
assumes all of the obligations of Seller hereunder, provided that no such
assignment shall release Seller from its duties and obligations hereunder.      10.04 Severability; Suspension Provisions. If in any jurisdiction, any
provision of this Agreement or its application to any party or circumstance is
restricted, prohibited or unenforceable, such provision shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective only to the extent of such restriction, prohibition
or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof and
without affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other
jurisdiction or its application to other parties or circumstances. In addition,
if any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall for any
reason in any jurisdiction be held to be excessively broad as to time, duration,
geographical scope, activity or subject, it shall be construed, by limiting and
reducing it, so as to be enforceable to the extent compatible with the
applicable law of such jurisdiction as it shall then appear.      10.05 Governing Law; Arbitration.            (a) All of the terms, conditions, and other provisions of this
Agreement shall be interpreted and governed by reference to the laws of the
State of New York, and any dispute arising therefrom and the remedies available
shall be determined in accordance with such laws without giving effect to the
principles of conflicts of law.            (b) Any disagreement, dispute, controversy or claim arising out of
or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination or validity thereof (a
"Dispute"), shall first be negotiated between the Chief Executive Officer of
Seller or his designee (on behalf of Seller), on the one hand, and the Chief
Executive Officer of Cyber Digital or his designee (on behalf of Purchaser), on
the other hand, for attempted resolution by good faith negotiation within thirty
(30) days after the parties have been notified that a Dispute exists.            (c) In the event that respective Chief Executive Officers (or their
designees) are unable to resolve such Dispute within such thirty (30) day
period, said Dispute shall be referred to binding arbitration for resolution in
accordance with the Rules for Non-Administered Arbitration of Business Disputes,
promulgated by the Center for Public Resources, 366 Madison Avenue, New York,
New York 10019 ("CPR") and in effect as of the date of this Agreement.
                                       36
<PAGE>            (d) The arbitration shall be held in New York, New York unless
Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to an alternate
location, in which case the arbitration shall be held at such alternate
location. There shall be one arbitrator who shall be an attorney specializing in
mergers and acquisitions law with at least fifteen (15) years of experience and
who shall be appointed from a list of such attorneys maintained by the CPR or a
member of the Judicial Panel of the Center of Public Resources for the
resolution of disputes similar to the Dispute. Each party shall have the right
to exercise two (2) peremptory challenges within 48 hours of being advised of
the selection of an arbitrator.            (e) After consulting with the parties, the arbitrator shall devise
procedures and deadlines for the arbitration with the goal of expediting the
proceeding and completing the arbitration within sixty (60) days after the date
of referral. There shall be no discovery other than limited document discovery
which may be granted to the extent reasonable and necessary as determined in the
discretion of the arbitrator. Neither party shall be entitled to discovery as a
matter of right.            (f) The arbitrator shall render his or her decision and proscribe a
fair and reasonable award within thirty (30) calendar days of the close of the
arbitration proceeding. The arbitrator's award will state the sum of money, if
any, and any equitable relief to be awarded with no statement of reasons. The
parties shall pay their own costs, fees and expenses of the procedures set forth
in this Section 10.05. The arbitrator shall decide the matter as would a United
States District Judge sitting in the case, whether under its diversity or
federal question jurisdiction, except that Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
shall not apply, except as specifically determined by the arbitrator. The
arbitrator shall premise the award upon the claimant's legal right to recovery
based on the terms of this agreement and the applicable law of the State of New
York, without regard to conflict of laws rules, together with any applicable
provisions of the laws of the United States.            (g) The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding upon the
parties and their respective heirs, executors, assigns and personal
administrators. Barring the existence of any circumstance specified by law for
the vacatur of the award, the award shall be complied with by the party against
whom it is directed without necessity for an application to the court for
confirmation of the award. A judgment may be entered on the award by any court
having competent jurisdiction. The parties to this agreement hereby consent and
submit their person to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York and any New York State court in New York
County for the enforcement of these provisions and any award rendered hereunder.            (h) The arbitrator shall not be an employee, director, trustee or
shareholder of any party or an Affiliate of any of the above-referenced Persons,
shall be independent and impartial and shall abide by the Ethical Standards of
Professional Responsibility issued by the Society of Professionals in Dispute
Resolution in effect as of the date of this Agreement. Prior to accepting an
appointment in this case, the arbitrator must promptly disclose any
circumstances likely to create a reasonable inference of bias or conflict of
interest or likely to preclude completion of the hearings within the prescribed
time schedule. The arbitrator may be removed for cause consisting of actual
bias, conflict of interest or other serious potential for conflict.
                                       37
<PAGE>            (i) The proportion in which the parties shall pay the costs, fees
and expenses of the procedures set forth in this Section 10.05 pursuant to
paragraph (e) above shall be split 50-50 between Seller, on the one hand, and
Purchaser, on the other hand. Each party shall pay its own costs (including,
without limitation, attorneys' fees and disbursements) and expenses in
connection with these procedures.            (j) Any negotiations hereunder or any proceedings with an arbitrator
shall be private and confidential. Except as may be required by applicable law,
no party shall make (or instruct the arbitrator or any other Person to make) any
public announcement with respect to the proceedings or decisions without the
prior written consent of the other party hereto. The existence of any Dispute
submitted to an arbitrator hereunder, and the award of such arbitrator, shall be
kept in the strictest confidence by the parties and such arbitrator, except as
may be required in connection with the enforcement of such award or as otherwise
required by applicable law.            (k) Each party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally consents to
the service of any and all process in any such action or proceeding by the
mailing of copies of such process by certified mail to such party and its, his
